Newspapers and journalists still fail to understand the current threat to democracy.
Most newspapers in my home state do realize enough to place the headlines from the January 6th commission front page.

But then fail to place the state's treasonous senator on the fron page with it.

Maybe it's just me, but I do not see how Ron Johnson's participation in the coup on page 1 is a page 7 update.
