Here is some great Wikipedia pettiness from a (I'm assuming) Michigan fan after a brutal loss to Louisville that eliminated them from the NCAA Tournament.

Here's a link to the video.

To be fair, this is a bad blown call. I'm not blaming the initial call (that's why we have review!) but then to not overturn it is rough and justifies the pettiness.
